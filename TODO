TODO list

General:
  ✔ Rename from RodoFareSim to RodoTollSim @done (13-08-07)
  ✔ Organize unit tests and binaries @done (13-07-31)

Main implementation:
  ✔ Definitions: @done (13-07-26)
    ✔ Network @done (13-07-26)
    ✔ O/D survey @done (13-07-26)
  ☐ Shortest paths:
    ✔ Basic: Bellman-Ford @done (13-07-26)
    ✔ Bellman-Ford optimization: @done (13-08-20)
      ✔ Early exit @done (13-08-18)
      ☐ Full optimization @comment (implement an actual queue of arcs yet to be relaxed)
    ✔ Improved/faster: Dijkstra @comment (really only depends on a good D-ary heap) @done (13-08-21 18:35)
    ✔ Are there any heuristics that can be used? @done (13-08-21)
  ✔ General structures, algorithms and formats: @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ CSV input @comment (port/optimize from jonasmalacofilho/jonas-haxe) @done (13-08-05)
    ✔ D-ary heap @comment (port/optimize from jonasmalacofilho/jonas-haxe) @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ R-Tree (RjTree) @comment (port from jonasmalacofilho/jonas-haxe) @done (13-08-21)

  ✔ Network formats: @done (13-08-20)
    ✔ Node @done (13-08-18)
    ✔ Link @done (13-08-18)
  ✔ O/D survey data format @done (13-08-20)
  ✔ Simulator application: @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Settings @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Input @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Run @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Output @done (13-08-21)
  ✔ Volume output mode assignment @done (13-08-21)

Additional (optional) improvements:
  ☐ Compute error estimes during the assignments
  ☐ Compute debug/auxiliary graphs during the assignments
  ✔ Build maps of the network and/or of the assignment volumes during/after the assignments @done (13-08-20)

Unit testing:
  ✔ Digraph construction @done (13-07-29)
  ✔ Bellman-Ford shortest paths @comment (the fold function can be used for this) @done (13-07-30)
  ✔ Volume output assignment @comment (the fold function can be used for this) @done (13-07-30)

Performance testing:
  ✔ Bellman-Ford performance with full network and all O/D surveys @done (13-08-20)

Production testing:
  ✔ Full O/D assignment: @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Dist costs only @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Time costs only @done (13-08-21)
    ✔ Dist+time costs @done (13-08-21)
